Config App
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple application using Zend Framework 2, Doctrine 2 and ExtJS 4.2. This application
allows the user to retrieve configuration settings from a MySQL table and also save them.

When finished, the aim is to have an example of how to create a very simple application that is
fully covered by unit tests, both client side and server side.
